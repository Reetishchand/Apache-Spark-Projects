Network was collected by crawling Amazon website. It is based on Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought feature of the Amazon website. If a product i is frequently co-purchased with product j, the graph contains an undirected edge from i to j. Each product category provided by Amazon defines each ground-truth community.

We regard each connected component in a product category as a separate ground-truth community. We remove the ground-truth communities which have less than 3 nodes. We also provide the top 5,000 communities with highest quality which are described in our paper. As for the network, we provide the largest connected component.

First, indivdual vertices are identified by getting the distinct FromNodeId and ToNodeId and then doing a union on both of them.
These are the vertices.

Next, the graphs edges are formed with the FromNodeId and ToNodeId

The Graph is formed using vertices and edges - using both GraphX and GraphFrames

OutDegree - indicates the amount of people a person trusts. The top 5 are displayed here.
InDegree- indicates the amount, a person is trusted. The top 5 are displayed here.
pagerank - indicates the important trusted people
connected components - through this, we can approximate clusters and every component is labelled
triangle count - this indicates a mutual trust sharing relationship.
